DVD Style Bouncing Emoji

Description

This is a simple web-based application that simulates the classic DVD logo bounce but with a twist! Instead of the DVD logo, we use a waving hand emoji (ðŸ‘‹). It's a fun and minimalistic way to add some interactivity and nostalgia to your web page.

How to Use

Open the emoji-dvd.html file in a web browser.
Watch the emoji bounce around the screen, just like the classic DVD logo!
Implementation Details

The application uses vanilla JavaScript for animation and HTML/CSS for structure and styling.

HTML: Sets up the basic structure and includes the emoji inside a div element.
CSS: Contains styles to ensure the emoji is displayed properly and to prevent overflow.
JavaScript: Handles the animation logic. It calculates the position of the emoji and changes its direction when it hits the edge of the screen.
Customization

If you'd like to use a different emoji or character:

Open the emoji-dvd.html file in a text editor.
Locate the line <div id="emoji">ðŸ‘‹</div>.
Replace the emoji inside the div tags with your preferred emoji or character.
Save the file and reload it in your browser.
